<p>I graduated from the <em>University of the Cumberlands</em> in December of 2022 with degree in <i><strong>Elementary Education</i></strong>. 
I served as vice president of the Education Club during my time in the education program. After graduation, I became a full-time substitute teacher. 
<br>I have been able to substitute teach every grade level of elementary school. I have also taught every subject in each grade. I have loved my time getting to see the different grade levels and learn more about the students in each group. I started the School Librarian program in January of this year. I have enjoyed all of the courses I have been able to take so far, and I look forward to completing my degree and becoming a <em>library media specialist</em>.</br> For the upcoming school year, I have just accepted a full time teaching position at Bush Elementary School in London, KY. </p>
