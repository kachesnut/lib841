<h2>About Me</h2> 

<p>My name is <strong>Karson Chesnut</strong>. 
I am from London, KY. I have recently gotten engaged and am getting married at the end of the summer. I have three siblings and a whole bunch of nieces and nephews. I love getting to spend time with my family outside of school. I love being outside and exploring. I also love to travel and am looking forward to going to Europe this summer. I have lived in London my entire life and grew up loving my school and public library. As I went through school I quickly realized that I wanted to become a librarian.
